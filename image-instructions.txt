BUNNY BREEDING SIMULATOR - IMAGE INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================

For the best experience with the Bunny Breeding Simulator, you should save three images with specific names:

1. photo-a.jpg - The first image in the breeding sequence
   This should be an image of a rabbit or bunny in a starting position.

2. photo-b.jpg - The second image in the breeding sequence
   This should be a similar image to the first, but showing movement or a different position.
   This image is toggled when pressing spacebar rapidly.

3. photo-c.jpg - The final image in the breeding sequence
   This should be the "completion" image shown at the end.

If you don't have all three images:
- The simulator will still work with just photo-a.jpg
- We'll automatically apply slight variations to photo-a.jpg to simulate movement
- For the best experience, use all three images

Image Tips:
- Use JPG format for all images
- For best performance, keep image file sizes under 1MB each
- Images should be at least 800x600 pixels for good quality
- The simulator will scale images to fit the screen

Saving Images:
1. Right-click on your image file
2. Select "Save As"
3. Navigate to the same folder as this simulator
4. Name the file exactly as specified above (photo-a.jpg, etc.)
5. Click Save

After saving your images, restart the server script to see your changes!

Enjoy breeding your bunnies!
